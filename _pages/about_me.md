I am the Data and Machine Learning Engineer at [Jump](https://jump.work), where I work on the entire machine learning pipeline, from analysis and modelling to deployment. At Jump, we help candidates and companies find their perfect match. This is done by using several Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods to evaluate candidates' suitability and interest to jobs registered in our platform.

I recently received my PhD on Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo (USP) - Brazil, where I worked with [Moacir A. Ponti](https://sites.google.com/site/moacirponti/) on the analysis of feature spaces created by Deep Learning and Representation Learning methods used to learn spatio-temporal features from videos. During my PhD, I was a research intern at the University of Edinburgh, working with [Timothy Hospedales](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) on the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for knowledge transfer applied to Computer Vision tasks.

I have a Bachelor's degree and an Master's degree in Computer Science also from USP. During my MSc, my research focused on pattern recognition and anomaly detection. Other research projects I took part on focused on: Deep Learning methods for Anomaly Detection, the impact of quantisation and noise on the performance of different Deep Learning architectures, Multimodal Data Paring, Zero-shot Learning and Few-shot Learning. I am also interested me in statistical learning theory, reinforcement learning and data visualisation.

## Education

* __(2014 - 2019)__ - University of São Paulo: Ph.D. Student  
__Representation learning of spatio-temporal features from videos.__   
_Advisor:_ Moacir Antonelli Ponti   
Research supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).
<!-- _Keywords:_ Representation learning, deep learning, computer vision, video processing, feature extraction, spatio-temporal features.    -->
<!-- _Abstract:_ The method that is presently considered the state of the art on extraction of spatio-temporal features from videos is based on finding key points and dense trajectories to apply classical feature extraction algorithms, like SIFT and HOG. With the recent improvement on the processing capacity of CPUs and GPUs, combined with the increasing availability of video and image datasets, representation learning methods, specially deep learning methods, have reached state of the art performance in several areas in artificial intelligence and signal processing. Even with the good results obtained by these methods, they have only been applied a few times to spatio-temporal feature extraction from videos a few times. Research in this area have achieved promising results, however, most of the methods focus on a single application, restricting the use of the learned features. Also, there are promising concepts that were used to design hand-crafted features and were not yet tested in a representation learning context. In this project, we propose the development of representation learning algorithms for extraction of spatio-temporal features from videos. We expect that these methods will be able to extract features that are capable of describing events that can't be capture through a single frame, but with the development of a scene. We intend for these features to form a multidimensional time series that encodes spatial information. To evaluate the quality of the representations, visualization and projection techniques will be used to permit the analysis of the feature space. We will also use methods that allow us to visualize extracted features, this way it will be possible to create a connection between features and the events that occur in the videos. -->
